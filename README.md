# Process

[How did you go about creating this project]

Project planning

- Discussed timelines and blockers in daily standups

Design planning 
- We used figma and trello to create timelines and tickets needed to complete our project.
- As a group, we used figma to look through reference applications that we had found individually. 
- Analysed aspects we liked from the website and discussed on Figma
- Front end team drew up Figma wireframe with back end teams input to create a look we were all happy with. 

Organising and planning 
- Shared screen on Slack and worked together using pair programming and mob programming
